- In fact, it is said that the lion's hunting success rate is less than 20 percent.<br>
- They mainly live in Africa and live in groups.<br>
- There's a lot of talk about who would win if a lion and a tiger fight, but in reality, they can't meet each other. Because the places they live are different.
